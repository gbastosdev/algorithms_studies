# Greedy Algorithm
- Problem-solving approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution.
- Simple and efficient, but does not always guarantee the best solution for all problems.

## Key
- Make the best immediate choice at each step.
- Does not reconsider past decisions (no backtracking).
- Often used for optimization problems (e.g., shortest path, scheduling, coin change).
